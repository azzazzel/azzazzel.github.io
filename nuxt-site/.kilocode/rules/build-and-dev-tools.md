# build-and-dev-tools.md

This project uses pnpm for package management.

## Guidelines

- Always use `pnpm` and not `npm` or `yarn` for installing dependencies and running scripts.
- Usually there is `pnpm dev` runnign in the background during development. Do not attempt to start another instance of it.
