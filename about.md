Iâ€™ve been building various kinds of software and have played multiple roles in the IT industry for the last {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: 1995 }} years!

### What I do

Since 2020 I am a Developer Advocate at [AxonIQ](http://axoniq.io), where I effectively lead the Developer Relations team. Next to Java and modularity, I deepen and share my knowledge about Domain-Driven Design, Command and Query Responsibility Separation, Event Sourcing, and similar architectural concepts.


I'm a [frequent conference speaker](/talks) trying my best to share my experience with fellow developers and collect meaningful feedback from our users.

I still enjoy coding and use every occasion to do so - customer solutions, contributing to Open Source projects, various private projects, etc. I always find a reason to code :)


### What I have done in the past

From 2017 to 2020, I was a Developer Advocate at [Liferay](http://liferay.com). Firstly a member and then a leader of the Developer Relations team. My main focus was on Java and modularity-related aspects!

From 2012 to 2016, I spent most of my time working as a senior consultant and trainer at [Liferay](http://liferay.com). A role that allowed me to learn a lot while helping some of the biggest European companies engage with their customers, partners, and employees in this rapidly changing digital world.

From 2009 to 2012, I was working as a software architect, and head of _(what was known as)_ portals competence center at another great company called [AMG.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20140108082734/http://www.amg.net.pl/en) which unfortunately does not exists anymore! It was both challenging and rewarding to design and deliver enterprise software for some of the biggest companies in the telecommunication industry in Europe.


### Programming background

Starting with [Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) _(as almost everyone back in early 90s)_ I quickly moved to [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) and then [Delphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)). Then the Internet came to my country and forced me to learn [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) and some [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). An eyeopening experience was discovering the existence of [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) which I used for several years before finally moving to [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: 2002 }} years ago! That long journey went through rather huge amount of technologies and frameworks like [Swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)), [EJB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_JavaBeans), [Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework), [Portlets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Portlet_Specification) to mostly concentrate around [OSGi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi) these days!

### Other

While I don't rely on certificates, and I am typically skeptical about certification authorities, they seem to be essential for some people! To make those people feel more comfortable about my skills and knowledge, I have [attended some training and earned some certificates](/certificates)!
