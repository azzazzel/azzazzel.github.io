Iâ€™ve been building various kinds of software and have played multiple roles in the IT industry for the last {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: 1999 }} years!

### What I do

Since 2025 I am a Developer Advocate at [Pinecone](http://pinecone.io). My focus is on exploring ways to harness AI to enhance developers' experience and productivity rather than replace them.


I'm a [frequent conference speaker](/talks) trying my best to share my experience with fellow developers and collect meaningful feedback from our users.

I still enjoy coding and use every occasion to do so - customer solutions, contributing to Open Source projects, various private projects, etc. I always find a reason to code :)


### What I have done in the past

From 2020 to 2024 I was a Developer Advocate at [AxonIQ](http://axoniq.io), where I effectively led the Developer Relations team. Next to Java and modularity, I deepened and shared my knowledge about Domain-Driven Design, Command and Query Responsibility Separation, Event Sourcing, and similar architectural concepts.

From 2017 to 2020, I was a Developer Advocate at [Liferay](http://liferay.com). Firstly a member and then a leader of the Developer Relations team. My main focus was on Java and modularity-related aspects!

From 2012 to 2016, I spent most of my time working as a senior consultant and trainer at [Liferay](http://liferay.com). A role that allowed me to learn a lot while helping some of the biggest European companies engage with their customers, partners, and employees in this rapidly changing digital world.

From 2009 to 2012, I was working as a software architect, and head of _(what was known as)_ portals competence center at another great company called [AMG.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20140108082734/http://www.amg.net.pl/en) which unfortunately does not exists anymore! It was both challenging and rewarding to design and deliver enterprise software for some of the biggest companies in the telecommunication industry in Europe.

From 2002 to 2009, I was in various software development roles (mid to senior level). I was part of teams building POS terminals, CRM systems, banking/insurance/credit systems, online stores, telecommunication services, etc.

From 1999 to 2002, I was a freelancer building websites and relatively simple online services (mainly using Perl).

### Programming background

Starting with [Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) _(as almost everyone back in early 90s)_ I quickly moved to [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) and then [Delphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)). Then the Internet came to my country and forced me to learn [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) and some [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). An eyeopening experience was discovering the existence of [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) which I used for several years before finally moving to [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: 2001 }} years ago! That long journey went through rather huge amount of technologies and frameworks like [Swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)), [EJB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_JavaBeans), [Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework), [Portlets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Portlet_Specification), [OSGi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi) and countless others!

### Other

While I don't rely on certificates, and I am typically skeptical about certification authorities, they seem to be essential for some people! To make those people feel more comfortable about my skills and knowledge, I have [attended some training and earned some certificates](/certificates)!
