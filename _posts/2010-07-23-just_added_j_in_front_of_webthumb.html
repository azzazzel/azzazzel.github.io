<p>Yep, good guess, a Java API to <a href="http://webthumb.bluga.net">bluga.net webthumb</a> in now available. Making your Java application display website thumbnails is now something really easy to implement. Get your API KEY form <a style="text-decoration: none; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; color: rgb(61, 123, 34); " href="http://webthumb.bluga.net">bluga.net webthumb</a>, download <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jwebthumb/files/">JWebThumb</a> and start requesting and fetching thumbnails with just a few lines of code. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>Why&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: underline; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; color: rgb(61, 123, 34); " href="http://webthumb.bluga.net">bluga.net webthumb</a>? Nope, I'm not gonna tell you it's the best tool out there, having unique features, ... or any of this marketing bla bla. The truth is, it was the first tool I found, that met my requirements</div>     <ul><li>custom size thumbnails</li><li>support for both JPG an PNG</li><li>web services or REST based API</li><li>either creates thumbnail instantly or sends notification when done</li><li>free version&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>I gave it a try and it turned out it's quite fast and reliable. Not that I have been heavily using it, but so far I haven't had any problems with it. Most of the time when I request a thumbnail it estimates it will take about 20 second but in fact my servlet receives notification in less than 2 seconds.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, after a few days of playing with webthumb's API I had a pile of Java snippets testing different aspects of it. Organizing the chaos resulted in version 0.1 of <span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; "><b>JWebThumb</b></span> project. Added data model and error handling on the top of that and 0.2 version was ready to go public (under LGPL). As usual Maven helped create a <a href="http://jwebthumb.sourceforge.net/">project site</a> from where you can learn how to use <span style="font-family: 'Courier New'; "><b>JWebThumb</b></span>, the <a href="http://github.com/azzazzel/JWebThumb">source code</a> is on GitHub and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jwebthumb/files/">downloads</a> are available on SourceForge. &nbsp;If you find a bug or missing feature don't hesitate to <a href="http://github.com/azzazzel/JWebThumb/issues">create an issue</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I consider 0.2 an early beta version. It works but it's not extensively tested and may have bugs. It uses <a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org/">XStream</a> for XML serialization and deserialization thus you can not yet use it on <a href="http://appengine.google.com/">GAE</a>. So version 0.3 is already underway having&nbsp;<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><a style="text-decoration: none; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; color: rgb(61, 123, 34); " href="http://xstream.codehaus.org/">XStream</a>&nbsp;replaced by <a href="http://simple.sourceforge.net/">Simple</a> so it works on&nbsp;<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"><a style="text-decoration: none; outline-style: none; outline-width: initial; outline-color: initial; color: rgb(61, 123, 34); " href="http://appengine.google.com/">GAE</a>. But before I release it I would like to test it a bit more and perhaps add support for <a href="http://webthumb.bluga.net/apidoc#status">'status' requests</a> missing in 0.2. So stay tuned, it shouldn't &nbsp;take too long.</meta></meta></p>
