It's been a while since my last post here. Apart from the traditional 'no time'
excuse, there is one more. Since I joined [Liferay](http://liferay.com) last year,
my Liferay related blogs are now on Liferay's website:
<a href="http://www.liferay.com/web/milen.dyankov/blog">http://www.liferay.com/web/milen.dyankov/blog</a>.

I don't think cross blogging is a good idea, so I didn't want copy them here as
well. However some people have asked to at least add here a link to my other blogs
whenever I publish something new. So here are the links for the ones that are
already out there:

 - [Liferay source code history - a piece of art](http://www.liferay.com/web/milen.dyankov/blog/-/blogs/liferay-source-code-history-a-piece-of-art) - Shows what it takes to build a product like Liferay in a very visual way
 - [The power (user) is back](http://www.liferay.com/web/milen.dyankov/blog/-/blogs/the-power-user-is-back) - An attempt to explain how User and PowerUser roles differ and what they are used for
 - [Mobile Device Recognition beyond the UI](http://www.liferay.com/web/milen.dyankov/blog/-/blogs/mobile-device-recognition-beyond-the-ui) - Revealing some not very well know features of Liferay's mobile device recognition feature

From now on, I'll try to announce here my Liferay blogs. I also have some thought to share on different technologies
(like [Karaf](http://karaf.apache.org/), [OrientDB](http://www.orientdb.org/) and [AngularJs](http://angularjs.org/) to mention a few)
but those require more time to prepare.
