<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to my new blog powered by Movable Type. Finally got it up and running but it took me a few hours. Cutting the long story short, here is a note of what problems I had and how they were solved.</p>

<!--more-->

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since there was no Movable Type package for Ubuntu 8.04 I downloaded version 4.23 from <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">http://www.movabletype.org/</a> and unpacked it locally. Then I created&nbsp; <small><code>/usr/lib/cgi-bin/movabletype/ </code></small>folder, copied in there <small><code>*.cgi</code></small> files from <small><code>/path/to/movabletype/</code></small> and made symlinks to these folders <br /> <br /> <code class="block"> /usr/lib/cgi-bin/movabletype/default_templates -&gt; /path/to/movabletype/default_templates <br />/usr/lib/cgi-bin/movabletype/lib&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; /path/to/movabletype/lib<br />/usr/lib/cgi-bin/movabletype/plugins&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; /path/to/movabletype/plugins <br />/usr/lib/cgi-bin/movabletype/tmpl&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&gt; /path/to/movabletype/tmpl </code> <br /> I already had Apache configured so it was time to start the installation  wizard. But after typing <small><code>http://milen.commsen.com/cgi-bin/movabletype/mt.cgi</code></small> in Firefox I got: <br /> <br /> <code class="blockWhite"> Got an error: Base class package &quot;Class::Accessor::Fast&quot; is empty.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Perhaps you need to 'use' the module which defines that package first.) </code> <br /> Took me a while to figure out the name of the package containing this Perl module but once it was discovered  <br /> <br /> <code class="block">apt-get install libclass-accessor-perl</code> <br /> solved this issue and made room for t the next one:  <br /> <br /> <code class="blockWhite"> Got an error: Base class package &quot;Data::ObjectDriver::BaseObject&quot; is empty.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Perhaps you need to 'use' the module which defines that package first.) </code> <br /> The same problem, just different module, except this time there was no Ubuntu package for it. So I had to install it from <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, which was quite easy to do using <small><code>cpan</code></small> command. <br /> <br /> <code class="block"> bash$ cpan<br /><br /> cpan shell -- CPAN exploration and modules installation (v1.7602)<br /> ReadLine support available (try 'install Bundle::CPAN')<br /><br /> cpan&gt; </code>  <br /> I then typed  <br /> <br /> <code class="block"> cpan&gt; install Data::ObjectDriver<br /> </code> <br /> and after a while got this message: <br /> <br /> <code class="block"> *** Checking for Perl dependencies...<br />[Core Features]<br />- Test::Exception&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...missing.<br />- DBI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...loaded. (1.601)<br />- Class::Accessor::Fast&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...loaded. (0.31)<br />- Class::Data::Inheritable ...missing.<br />- Class::Trigger&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...missing.<br />- List::Util&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...loaded. (1.18)<br />==&gt; Auto-install the 3 mandatory module(s) from CPAN? [y]<br /> </code> <br /> Since missing modules depend on other missing modules I just let <small><code>cpan</code></small> handle dependencies and few minutes later problem was solved and now I had:  <br /> <br /> <code class="blockWhite"> Got an error: mutiple trigger registration in one add_trigger() call is deprecated. </code> <br /> Thanks to Google I found the solution in another blog entry called &quot;<a href="http://www.glorat.net/2008/11/movable-type-with-classtrigger-012.html">Movable Type with Class::Trigger 0.12</a>&quot; and after changing <br /> <br /> <code class="block"> MT::Placement-&gt;add_trigger(<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; post_save&nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt; \&amp;flush_category_cache,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; post_remove =&gt; \&amp;flush_category_cache<br /> );<br /> </code> <br /> to <br /> <br /> <code class="block"> MT::Placement-&gt;add_trigger(<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; post_save&nbsp;&nbsp; =&gt; \&amp;flush_category_cache<br /> );<br /> MT::Placement-&gt;add_trigger(<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; post_remove =&gt; \&amp;flush_category_cache<br /> );<br /> </code> <br /> in <small><code>MT/Entry.pm</code></small> I finally got installation wizard running. At some point, after checking for required modules, the wizard complained about missing <small><code>Image::Size</code></small> and I had had to do  <br /> <br /> <code class="block"> apt-get install libimage-size-perl. </code> <br />  There was also warning about missing optional modules so I also installed: <br /> <br /> <code class="block"> libmail-sendmail-perl<br /> libsoap-lite-perl<br /> libxml-atom-perl<br /> perlmagick<br /> libgd-gd2-noxpm-perl </code> <br /> Rest of configuration process went without problems but after completing the wizard I got: <br /> <br /> <code class="blockWhite"> Got an error: Can't locate YAML/Tiny.pm in @INC ... </code> <br /> Another Perl module missing? Looks like wizard didn't check for this one. So <br /> <br /> <code class="block">apt-get install libyaml-tiny-perl</code> <br /> added it but then another one showed up: <br /> <br /> <code class="blockWhite">Got an error: Can't locate JSON.pm in @INC</code> <br /> This was fixed by  <br /> <br /> <code class="block">apt-get install libjson-perl </code> <br /> and finally there was &quot;Create Your Account&quot; screen.&nbsp; Creating an account and adding a blog went without problems and I was able to move my old posts from Blogger and add this one. </p>
