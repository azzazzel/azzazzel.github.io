  Most Java developers happily use libraries in their applications. Moreover, many of them split their code into what they call modules, hoping that it brings benefits. Yet way too often, they end up having a (distributed?) big ball of mud sooner or later? This session aims to show why simply cutting things down into smaller pieces and calling them libraries, modules, micro-services, etc., does not work?

  In this talk, we'll go one abstraction level above and look at the process of decomposing a Java application into reusable components. We'll examine different ways to organize Java code in methods, classes, packages, and modules. We'll talk about hiding implementation details and enforcing module boundaries. Some of you will be surprised how well SOLID principles fits into the picture. But most important of all, we'll end up with an application design that has an excellent chance to evolve over the years without introducing additional accidental complexity.
