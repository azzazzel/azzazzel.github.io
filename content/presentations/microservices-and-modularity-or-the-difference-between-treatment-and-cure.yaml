  Everyone is talking about microservices these days! So the question is should you also jump on that bandwagon and why those somewhat older colleagues of yours (yep, those that still remember the EJB 2 revolution) are not that enthusiastic? To help you make the right decisions, this talk will first focus on explaining complexity - the problem microservices claim to solve. It then will concentrate on modular architecture and how it compares to what most people understand by microservices! Live demo will present multiple ways to modularize exiting JEE application going from "monolithic" Glassfish EJB/JSF style app through SpringBoot and OSGi to reach a distributed system with a portal as front-end.
