  If it is the first time you've heard the term, then this talk is for you! If you are concerned about Coherence, Coupling, and Connascence metrics while building applications, this talk is definitely for you. If the amount of things that can break prevents you from splitting a monolith into distributed micro-services, then applying location transparency may be both your kick-starter and your safety net.

  In this talk, we'll examine a traditional application with its dependencies between methods, classes, packages, and modules. We'll talk about how those impact applications' ability to grow and be decomposed into independently deployable units. Then we'll see how and where to apply location transparency. Finally, we'll rise above the code to explore how Domain-Driven Design, CQRS, and Event Sourcing architectural concepts tackle complexity and why location transparency is key while doing so.
