  Think the never ending project you company got you working on is boring and there is nothing you can do about it? Think again! You just recently (the day you were born) joined the "World" project! It has been around for billions of years and it's still improving! And guess what, you (as software developer) are extremely lucky because a new major release is being worked out and it's heavily based on ... software! So it's time to get excited and think about your role! Do you understand the project road map? Will you contribute? Will you join a team or work on your own? Will you learn or teach others? Will you lead or follow? Will you design or implement features? And last but not least, is it really only about software?
